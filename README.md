# my utilities

small personal utilities to better my life

**for now it includes:**
- a markdown to pdf converter
- and a font switcher for the kitty terminal **not finished**

the font switcher switches only the main font to the regular version of the desired font for now

# todo:
- ~add so you can change italic and bold fonts for the font utility~ -> brought a bug
- fix the bug where chosing regular doesn't change the regular font
- add so it doesn't quit the program when you choose a font but so it prompts you with another type of font
- make it so you can make templates
- ? maybe rewrite it in python
